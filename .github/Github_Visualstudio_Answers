):

name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - run: python setup.py install
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - run: pytest
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: docker build -t my-image .
      - run: docker push my-image

Explanation:

    Trigger: The workflow is triggered when there is a push to the

    master

    branch.
    Jobs: There are three jobs:

    build

    ,

    test

    , and

    deploy

    .
    Steps: Each job consists of steps that execute specific actions.
    Dependencies: The

    test

    job depends on the

    build

    job, and the

    deploy

    job depends on the

    test

    job.
    Actions: The actions used in this workflow include:

        actions/checkout@v2

        for checking out the repository code

        actions/setup-python@v2

        for setting up a Python environment

        pytest

        for running tests
        Docker commands for building and pushing a container image

This workflow automates the following steps:
